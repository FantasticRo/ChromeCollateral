### 📏 **What is ATR (Average True Range)?**

ATR measures **volatility**, not direction. It tells you how much an asset typically moves (up or down) over a period. Higher ATR = more volatility.

### 🎯 **What Are ATR Bands?**

ATR bands are **dynamic price bands** placed **above and below a moving average**, usually calculated like this:

- **Upper Band** = Moving Average + (Multiplier × ATR)
    
- **Lower Band** = Moving Average – (Multiplier × ATR)
    

Common settings:

- ATR period: 14 (default)
    
- Multiplier: 1, 2, or even 3 depending on how tight or loose you want the bands

### 🧠 **How Do Traders Use ATR Bands?**

#### 1. **Volatility Zones**

- When price hits or exceeds the upper band → potentially **overextended** move
    
- When price touches the lower band → possibly **oversold** or weakening trend
    

#### 2. **Breakout Confirmation**

- Price **breaking out above** upper ATR band? That’s often seen as **trend strength**, not necessarily a reversal.
    
- Same logic for downside.
    

#### 3. **Trailing Stops**

- ATR bands can help set **dynamic stop losses** that adjust with volatility.
    
    - Tight bands in low volatility.
        
    - Wider bands in high volatility.

### 📉 Example:

If BTC is trading at $60K, and its 14-day ATR is $2K:

- Upper ATR band at 1x multiplier = $60K + $2K = $62K
    
- Lower ATR band = $60K - $2K = $58K
    

If price surges to $63K, you're now **outside** the normal volatility envelope—expect pullback or explosive continuation.

### 🧙 Bonus Tip:

ATR bands are **volatility-reactive**, unlike Bollinger Bands which are **standard deviation-based**. That makes ATR bands extra useful in **non-normal** markets or **crypto**, where things don’t follow the rules and never say sorry.


Example 

1) review in dexscreener (atr setting 2 with 30 days)
2) check metrix
3) compare with revert open similar
   note: make sure age is more than 3 days and fee is the same tier

On entry like to be equidistant from top and bottom.

if exits on up
   on upside rebalance shift entire range up
   comfortable doing this because LP has a profit
   maybe shift up 3% instead of equidistant
if exits on bottom
   intentionally snuggle down but keep it out of range but close to spot
   could move whole range down to match but will be higher divergence loss#
